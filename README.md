# App Brainstorming
  - A user-friendly financial tracking app that can be linked to your bank account. It would be designed to help individuals manage their expenses, savings, and financial goals.
    I would incorporate visually appealing featured like graphs and pie charts to showcase monthy expenditures. It can also be a platform where users can share tips about saving and managing money.
