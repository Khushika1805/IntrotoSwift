This project is and introduction to using Xcode and Swift to introduce myself with UI in swift. This app allows you to change random background color through a button.
Below are apps and app features that I use and like. I have also included an app idea for students like me to manage their expenses and savings.

# App Brainstorming
  - A user-friendly financial tracking app that can be linked to your bank account. It would be designed to help individuals manage their expenses, savings, and financial goals.
    I would incorporate visually appealing featured like graphs and pie charts to showcase monthy expenditures. It can also be a platform where users can share tips about saving and managing money.
